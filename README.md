This is a testing ground for some ideas about spreadsheet-like calculations.

The calculation consists of a network of nodes.
Each node has an expression defining the calculation to perform,
which may rely on other nodes,
forming a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).

In a spreadsheet, there would be one node for each cell.
In the application I'm eventually hoping to use this in,
each node would be one property of a more complex entity.
